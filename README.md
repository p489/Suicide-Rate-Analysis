Performed EDA on the suicide dataset obtained from kaggle.

* Globally many people lose their lives by attempting suicide. 
* With the given data set I performed EDA to get more insights from the data and reveal the underlying trends.

## Observations
* During my analysis I found that suicide rates in Males are observed to be higher than that of females over the years. 
* As per this reference article https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190313-why-more-men-kill-themselves-than-women women are more prone to depression and to attempt suicide but the methods carried out by men during the attempt are more fatal that's why there is very less or no time for external intervention.
* Boomer generation (1946-1964) has shown a higher tendency for suicide rates.Reasons for most suicide cases in elder people maybe due to depression, social isolation, substance abuse, poor physical health or function, financial stress,etc.
